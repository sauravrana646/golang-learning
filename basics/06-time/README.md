### Time Module Go

Time module is tricky one as it has different set of lots and lots of inputs.

Also if we have format a time we have to follow some specific time and date to indicate the formatting of the time we want.

For example : If I want to format my time in a format like `DD-MM-YY Time AM/PM Day` then I would have to use `02-01-2006 15:04 PM Monday`. Now the interesting part is that all the time and dates and day I used in the formating is predefined and always be the same for any formatting. 

We can also look up it in the Go Documentation in the `time` module and under the `time.Format` method
